**BEST CAR FOR YOUR TRIP**  
  
This app helps you choose the most cost-effective car for your upcoming trip. 
It has been developed as a part of Developing Data Products course project at Coursera.  
Our aim is to find out the best car for you on the basis of data extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, 
and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).  
  
Source code for the app - ui.R and server.R files are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/madhuri333/ShinyApp).
